# Duplicate songs
At home I have a large music collection I have been building for several years. However, during this time it has accumualted many duplicates - this tools lets me find and choose which ones to delete based on metadata (namely, which files are better placed and have a higher bitrate).

I chose to use Rust as I wanted to learn the language and practice using it.
